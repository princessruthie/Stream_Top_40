    <string name="pop_textplanation">(Hey! This will have maybe a listview or recyclerview
    or something and it will have the 40 top POP songs.  All the songs will
    have a *play* icon but whichever song is playing will have an *in progress* sort of icon.
    This way the user doesn\'t have to use the backbutton to pick a different song.
    They can just pick another.  Since the list will be updating daily, we\'ll have to get
    the data off a server.  So maybe retrofit would be in order.  Also, the listview would
    have pictures.  So maybe picasso.  Thanks for reading!)  </string>
